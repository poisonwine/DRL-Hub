# Deep Reinforcement Learning Package

## Introduction

This is a deep reinforcement learning package including main-stream RL algorithms such as DDPG, TRPO, PPO, etc. It will be updated continuously to cover more up-to-date main-stream RL algorithms. It aims to help all the RL beginners and researchers understand and utilize RL algorithms more easily in their own research. All the included algorithms will be implemented so that they can achieve the claimed performance in the corresponding papers. By now, the following algorithms are nearly-SOTA:

**DDPG, NAF, TD3, TRPO, PPO** 

<font size=2 color=grey>**The Definition of "nearly-SOTA"**: *I don't have enough time to test all the envs included in the corresponding papers and provide the comparison with baselines. I just test my implemented version in one of the envs (most probable the Hopper-v2) and it achieves the same or higher performance compared with the baseline.*</font>

It also includes our newly proposed algorithm **Hindsight Trust Region Policy Optimization**. A demo video of **Hindsight Trust Region Policy Optimization** is in demo/ and it shows how our algorithm works. **Hindsight Trust Region Policy Optimization** has already been submitted to ICLR 2020.

### Examples
For running continuous envs (e.g. FetchPush-v1) with HTRPO algorithm:
```bash
python main.py --alg HTRPO --env FetchPush-v1 --num_steps 2000000 --num_evals 200 --eval_interval 19200 (--cpu)
```

For running discrete envs (e.g. FlipBit8):

```bash
python main.py --alg HTRPO --env FlipBit8 --unnormobs --num_steps 50000 --num_evals 200 --eval_interval 1024 (--cpu)
```

--cpu is used only when you want to train the policy using CPU, which will be much slower than using GPU.

--unnormobs is used when you do not want to do input normalization. In our paper, all the discrete envs do not use this trick at all.

**Note** for users: 

1. DDPG, TD3 and NAF should turn on the switches named "unnormobs" and "unnormret" during training. The normalization is not optimized for these 3 methods by now and hense, with observation normalization or return normalization, the performance will be much lower than the baselines.

2. All the experimental results compared with baselines will be continuously updated when I have time.

### Environment List

1. All the mojoco envs.

2. Our Discrete Envs: FlipBit8, FlipBit16, EmptyMaze, FourRoomMaze, FetchReachDiscrete, FetchPushDiscrete, FetchSlideDiscrete, MsPacman

All the listed names can be directly used in command line for training policies. BUT NOTE: sparse reward envs only support HTRPO and dense reward envs do not support HTRPO.
